Object
	Renderables
	Controllers

Render Order:
Background
Entity w/ lowest y co-ord
	Run through all x co-ords(?)
	
Fuck speed for now, just write code that you can re-use everywhere



Is a map a controller? Or its own object?
What makes a map special?
	The fact that it can hold other objects? Shouldn't be. What about more complex rederables w/ multiple unique parts? Vehicles should do this.

Could be nothing. Pro-controller arguments:
	Using map as a container allows easy passing of interesting parameters.
	
map:
	Holds renderables
		But how
	Holds init info. for renderables (e.g. position)
		Also how
	Other stuff???
	
Renderables and their init info for a map should be paired somehow... Hm...








Game::load(map mapToLoad)

THINGS THAT GET LOADED:
Renderables
Controllers
OR:
Controllers
	Renderables (contained in the 'map' controller)
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
FOR MAPS:
Hard and Soft map files.
.hrd = unchanging, obfuscated
.sft = contains all malleable entities (i.e. entities that can have their load params changed)
